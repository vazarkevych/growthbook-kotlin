/**
 * Remembers the value last reported for each feature, so usage is announced on a *change* rather
 * than on every evaluation. The counterpart of [GBExperimentHelper] for feature usage.
 *
 * A feature is typically read on every render or recomposition, which makes the raw evaluation
 * stream orders of magnitude larger than the number of value changes in it. The reference SDK
 * de-duplicates at this level (`trackedFeatureUsage` in core.ts) and gates every usage sink behind
 * it, so a consumer callback, a plugin and the ingest endpoint all see one report per distinct
 * value.
 *
 * Comparison is by [GBValue] equality rather than by serialized form. That is one deliberate
 * deviation from `JSON.stringify`: [com.sdk.growthbook.model.GBNumber] treats integer and
 * floating-point values distinctly, so a feature whose value flips between `1` and `1.0` reports
 * twice here and once there. Serializing on every evaluation to match would allocate on the hot
 * path for a case that cannot change what the value *means*.
 *
 * Bounded by the number of distinct feature keys evaluated, like the reference implementation.

     * A key that was never recorded always reports, including when its value is null: absent and
     * "evaluated to null" are different states, which is why membership is checked rather than
     * relying on a null lookup.
     *
     * The read-compare-write runs in a CAS loop, so two threads evaluating the same feature at the
     * same time cannot both be told to report: the loser re-reads the winner's value and sees no
     * change.
