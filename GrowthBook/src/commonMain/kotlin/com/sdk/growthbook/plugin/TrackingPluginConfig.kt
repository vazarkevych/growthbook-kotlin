/**
 * Configuration for [com.sdk.growthbook.plugin.tracking.GrowthBookTrackingPlugin]. Defaults: batch size 100, flush every 10 seconds,
 * ingestor host `https://us-east-1.gb-ingest.com`.
 *
 * **Frozen.** This class carries exactly the options it shipped with and will not gain more: it has
 * a public constructor, so every added parameter would break binary compatibility and leave behind
 * a constructor overload that has to be kept forever. New options live on
 * [com.sdk.growthbook.plugin.tracking.GrowthBookTrackingPlugin.Builder], which is the recommended
 * way to configure the plugin:
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * GrowthBookTrackingPlugin.Builder()
 *     .setClientKey("sdk-abc")
 *     .setNetworkDispatcher(dispatcher)
 *     .setEnableFeatureUsageEvents(false)
 *     .build()
 * ```
 *
 * Passing this config to the plugin keeps working and is not deprecated; it simply cannot express
 * options introduced after it was frozen, which take their defaults instead.
