/**
 * Batches experiment/feature evaluation events and POSTs them to the GrowthBook ingest endpoint.
 *
 * A flush is triggered when either the buffer reaches [com.sdk.growthbook.plugin.TrackingPluginConfig.resolvedBatchSize]
 * or a timer fires after [com.sdk.growthbook.plugin.TrackingPluginConfig.resolvedBatchTimeout]. [close] schedules a final
 * flush of any remaining buffered events and then cancels the coroutine scope.
 *
 * If the client key is null/empty the plugin becomes a no-op: event methods return immediately, no
 * HTTP traffic occurs, and [close] still completes cleanly.
 *
 * Configure it with [Builder]; the [TrackingPluginConfig] constructor is the frozen original entry
 * point and cannot express options added since (see [TrackingPluginConfig]).
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * GrowthBookTrackingPlugin.Builder()
 *     .setClientKey("sdk-abc")
 *     .setNetworkDispatcher(dispatcher)
 *     .setEnableFeatureUsageEvents(false)
 *     .build()
 * ```
 *
 * Besides the automatic feature and experiment events, it implements [CustomEventReceiver], so
 * explicit [com.sdk.growthbook.GrowthBookSDK.logEvent] calls are batched through the same pipeline
 * — matching the JS/Python SDKs' `logEvent` / `log_event`.
