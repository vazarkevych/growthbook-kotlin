/**
 * Guards the configuration DSL against drifting behind [GBSDKBuilder].
 *
 * This module is versioned and released separately from the core SDK, so a setter added to the
 * builder does not break anything here — the DSL simply stops offering it, silently, until someone
 * notices. That is exactly how five settings went missing between releases. This test turns the
 * next such gap into a CI failure at the moment the setter lands.
 *
 * It checks the *setter surface*, not behaviour: that every public `set*` on the builder is either
 * mapped by [GrowthBookConfigBuilder] or listed as a deliberate omission. `ConfigDslTest` covers
 * what the mapped ones actually do.
 *
 * JVM-only because it needs reflection; the DSL itself is common code, and the builder surface it
 * mirrors is identical on every target.
